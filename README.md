# DETECTION-OF-DDOS-ATTACK-USING-ENTROPY-APPROACH
This project presents a novel approach for the detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)attacks using an entropy-based method. DDoS attacks pose significant threats to network security by overwhelming target systems with a flood of malicious traffic, disrupting normal operation and causing service unavailability.
